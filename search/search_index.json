It started as a component of OkHttp , the capable HTTP client included in Android. It\u2019s well-exercised and ready to solve new problems. ByteStrings and Buffers \u00b6 Okio is built around two types that pack a lot of capability into a straightforward API: ByteString is an immutable sequence of bytes. For character data, String is fundamental. ByteString is String\u2019s long-lost brother, making it easy to treat binary data as a value. This class is ergonomic: it knows how to encode and decode itself as hex, base64, and UTF-8. Buffer is a mutable sequence of bytes. Like ArrayList , you don\u2019t need to size your buffer in advance. You read and write buffers as a queue: write data to the end and read it from the front. There\u2019s no obligation to manage positions, limits, or capacities. Internally, ByteString and Buffer do some clever things to save CPU and memory. If you encode a UTF-8 string as a ByteString , it caches a reference to that string so that if you decode it later, there\u2019s no work to do. Buffer is implemented as a linked list of segments. When you move data from one buffer to another, it reassigns ownership of the segments rather than copying the data across. This approach is particularly helpful for multithreaded programs: a thread that talks to the network can exchange data with a worker thread without any copying or ceremony. Sources and Sinks \u00b6 An elegant part of the java.io design is how streams can be layered for transformations like encryption and compression. Okio includes its own stream types called Source and Sink that work like InputStream and OutputStream , but with some key differences: Timeouts. The streams provide access to the timeouts of the underlying I/O mechanism. Unlike the java.io socket streams, both read() and write() calls honor timeouts. Easy to implement. Source declares three methods: read() , close() , and timeout() . There are no hazards like available() or single-byte reads that cause correctness and performance surprises. Easy to use. Although implementations of Source and Sink have only three methods to write, callers are given a rich API with the BufferedSource and BufferedSink interfaces. These interfaces give you everything you need in one place. No artificial distinction between byte streams and char streams. It\u2019s all data. Read and write it as bytes, UTF-8 strings, big-endian 32-bit integers, little-endian shorts; whatever you want. No more InputStreamReader ! Easy to test. The Buffer class implements both BufferedSource and BufferedSink so your test code is simple and clear. Sources and sinks interoperate with InputStream and OutputStream . You can view any Source as an InputStream , and you can view any InputStream as a Source . Similarly for Sink and OutputStream .

Decoding the Secrets of Binary Data ( slides ): How data encoding works and how Okio does it. Ok Multiplatform! ( slides ): How we changed Okio\u2019s implementation language from Java to Kotlin. Recipes \u00b6 We\u2019ve written some recipes that demonstrate how to solve common problems with Okio. Read through them to learn about how everything works together. Cut-and-paste these examples freely; that\u2019s what they\u2019re for. Read a text file line-by-line \u00b6 Use Okio.source(File) to open a source stream to read a file. The returned Source interface is very small and has limited uses. Instead we wrap the source with a buffer. This has two benefits: It makes the API more powerful. Instead of the basic methods offered by Source , BufferedSource has dozens of methods to address most common problems concisely. It makes your program run faster. Buffering allows Okio to get more done with fewer I/O operations. Each Source that is opened needs to be closed. The code that opens the stream is responsible for making sure it is closed. Here we use Java\u2019s try blocks to close our sources automatically. public void readLines ( File file ) throws IOException { try ( Source fileSource = Okio . source ( file ); BufferedSource bufferedSource = Okio . buffer ( fileSource )) { while ( true ) { String line = bufferedSource . readUtf8Line (); if ( line == null ) break ; if ( line . contains ( \"square\" )) { System . out . println ( line ); } } } } The readUtf8Line() API reads all of the data until the next line delimiter \u2013 either \\n , \\r\\n , or the end of the file. It returns that data as a string, omitting the delimiter at the end. When it encounters empty lines the method will return an empty string. If there isn\u2019t any more data to read it will return null. The above program can be written more compactly by inlining the fileSource variable and by using a fancy for loop instead of a while : public void readLines ( File file ) throws IOException { try ( BufferedSource source = Okio . buffer ( Okio . source ( file ))) { for ( String line ; ( line = source . readUtf8Line ()) != null ; ) { if ( line . contains ( \"square\" )) { System . out . println ( line ); } } } } The readUtf8Line() method is suitable for parsing most files. For certain use-cases you may also consider readUtf8LineStrict() . It is similar but it requires that each line is terminated by \\n or \\r\\n . If it encounters the end of the file before that it will throw an EOFException . The strict variant also permits a byte limit to defend against malformed input. public void readLines ( File file ) throws IOException { try ( BufferedSource source = Okio . buffer ( Okio . source ( file ))) { while (! source . exhausted ()) { String line = source . readUtf8LineStrict ( 1024L ); if ( line . contains ( \"square\" )) { System . out . println ( line ); } } } } Write a text file \u00b6 Above we used a Source and a BufferedSource to read a file. To write, we use a Sink and a BufferedSink . The advantages of buffering are the same: a more capable API and better performance. public void writeEnv ( File file ) throws IOException { try ( Sink fileSink = Okio . sink ( file ); BufferedSink bufferedSink = Okio . buffer ( fileSink )) { for ( Map . Entry < String , String > entry : System . getenv (). entrySet ()) { bufferedSink . writeUtf8 ( entry . getKey ()); bufferedSink . writeUtf8 ( \"=\" ); bufferedSink . writeUtf8 ( entry . getValue ()); bufferedSink . writeUtf8 ( \"\\n\" ); } } } There isn\u2019t an API to write a line of input; instead we manually insert our own newline character. Most programs should hardcode \"\\n\" as the newline character. In rare situations you may use System.lineSeparator() instead of \"\\n\" : it returns \"\\r\\n\" on Windows and \"\\n\" everywhere else. We can write the above program more compactly by inlining the fileSink variable and by taking advantage of method chaining: public void writeEnv ( File file ) throws IOException { try ( BufferedSink sink = Okio . buffer ( Okio . sink ( file ))) { for ( Map . Entry < String , String > entry : System . getenv (). entrySet ()) { sink . writeUtf8 ( entry . getKey ()) . writeUtf8 ( \"=\" ) . writeUtf8 ( entry . getValue ()) . writeUtf8 ( \"\\n\" ); } } } In the above code we make four calls to writeUtf8() . Making four calls is more efficient than the code below because the VM doesn\u2019t have to create and garbage collect a temporary string. sink . writeUtf8 ( entry . getKey () + \"=\" + entry . getValue () + \"\\n\" ); // Slower! UTF-8 \u00b6 In the above APIs you can see that Okio really likes UTF-8. Early computer systems suffered many incompatible character encodings: ISO-8859-1, ShiftJIS, ASCII, EBCDIC, etc. Writing software to support multiple character sets was awful and we didn\u2019t even have emoji! Today we\u2019re lucky that the world has standardized on UTF-8 everywhere, with some rare uses of other charsets in legacy systems. If you need another character set, readString() and writeString() are there for you. These methods require that you specify a character set. Otherwise you may accidentally create data that is only readable by the local computer. Most programs should use the UTF-8 methods only. When encoding strings you need to be mindful of the different ways that strings are represented and encoded. When a glyph has an accent or another adornment it may be represented as a single complex code point ( \u00e9 ) or as a simple code point ( e ) followed by its modifiers ( \u00b4 ). When the entire glyph is a single code point that\u2019s called NFC ; when it\u2019s multiple it\u2019s NFD . Though we use UTF-8 whenever we read or write strings in I/O, when they are in memory Java Strings use an obsolete character encoding called UTF-16. It is a bad encoding because it uses a 16-bit char for most characters, but some don\u2019t fit. In particular, most emoji use two Java chars. This is problematic because String.length() returns a surprising result: the number of UTF-16 chars and not the natural number of glyphs. Caf\u00e9 \ud83c\udf69 Cafe\u0301 \ud83c\udf69 Form NFC NFD Code Points c a f \u00e9 \u2423 \ud83c\udf69 c a f e \u00b4 \u2423 \ud83c\udf69 UTF-8 bytes 43 61 66 c3a9 20 f09f8da9 43 61 66 65 cc81 20 f09f8da9 String.codePointCount 6 7 String.length 7 8 Utf8.size 10 11 For the most part Okio lets you ignore these problems and focus on your data. But when you need them, there are convenient APIs for dealing with low-level UTF-8 strings. Use Utf8.size() to count the number of bytes required to encode a string as UTF-8 without actually encoding it. This is handy in length-prefixed encodings like protocol buffers. Use BufferedSource.readUtf8CodePoint() to read a single variable-length code point, and BufferedSink.writeUtf8CodePoint() to write one. Golden Values \u00b6 Okio likes testing. The library itself is heavily tested, and it has features that are often helpful when testing application code. One pattern we\u2019ve found to be quite useful is \u201cgolden value\u201d testing. The goal of such tests is to confirm that data encoded with earlier versions of a program can safely be decoded by the current program. We\u2019ll illustrate this by encoding a value using Java Serialization. Though we must disclaim that Java Serialization is an awful encoding system and most programs should prefer other formats like JSON or protobuf! In any case, here\u2019s a method that takes an object, serializes it, and returns the result as a ByteString : private ByteString serialize ( Object o ) throws IOException { Buffer buffer = new Buffer (); try ( ObjectOutputStream objectOut = new ObjectOutputStream ( buffer . outputStream ())) { objectOut . writeObject ( o ); } return buffer . readByteString (); } There\u2019s a lot going on here. We create a buffer as a holding space for our serialized data. It\u2019s a convenient replacement for ByteArrayOutputStream . We ask the buffer for its output stream. Writes to a buffer or its output stream always append data to the end of the buffer. We create an ObjectOutputStream (the encoding API for Java serialization) and write our object. The try block takes care of closing the stream for us. Note that closing a buffer has no effect. Finally we read a byte string from the buffer. The readByteString() method allows us to specify how many bytes to read; here we don\u2019t specify a count in order to read the entire thing. Reads from a buffer always consume data from the front of the buffer. With our serialize() method handy we are ready to compute and print a golden value. Point point = new Point ( 8.0 , 15.0 ); ByteString pointBytes = serialize ( point ); System . out . println ( pointBytes . base64 ()); We print the ByteString as base64 because it\u2019s a compact format that\u2019s suitable for embedding in a test case. The program prints this: rO0ABXNyAB5va2lvLnNhbXBsZXMuR29sZGVuVmFsdWUkUG9pbnTdUW8rMji1IwIAAkQAAXhEAAF5eHBAIAAAAAAAAEAuAAAAAAAA That\u2019s our golden value! We can embed it in our test case using base64 again to convert it back into a ByteString : ByteString goldenBytes = ByteString . decodeBase64 ( \"rO0ABXNyAB5va2lvLnNhbXBsZ\" + \"XMuR29sZGVuVmFsdWUkUG9pbnTdUW8rMji1IwIAAkQAAXhEAAF5eHBAIAAAAAAAAEAuA\" + \"AAAAAAA\" ); The next step is to deserialize the ByteString back into our value class. This method reverses the serialize() method above: we append a byte string to a buffer then consume it using an ObjectInputStream : private Object deserialize ( ByteString byteString ) throws IOException , ClassNotFoundException { Buffer buffer = new Buffer (); buffer . write ( byteString ); try ( ObjectInputStream objectIn = new ObjectInputStream ( buffer . inputStream ())) { return objectIn . readObject (); } } Now we can test the decoder against the golden value: ByteString goldenBytes = ByteString . decodeBase64 ( \"rO0ABXNyAB5va2lvLnNhbXBsZ\" + \"XMuR29sZGVuVmFsdWUkUG9pbnTdUW8rMji1IwIAAkQAAXhEAAF5eHBAIAAAAAAAAEAuA\" + \"AAAAAAA\" ); Point decoded = ( Point ) deserialize ( goldenBytes ); assertEquals ( new Point ( 8.0 , 15.0 ), decoded ); With this test we can change the serialization of the Point class without breaking compatibility. Write a binary file \u00b6 Encoding a binary file is not unlike encoding a text file. Okio uses the same BufferedSink and BufferedSource bytes for both. This is handy for binary formats that include both byte and character data. Writing binary data is more hazardous than text because if you make a mistake it is often quite difficult to diagnose. Avoid such mistakes by being careful around these traps: The width of each field. This is the number of bytes used. Okio doesn\u2019t include a mechanism to emit partial bytes. If you need that, you\u2019ll need to do your own bit shifting and masking before writing. The endianness of each field. All fields that have more than one byte have endianness : whether the bytes are ordered most-significant to least (big endian) or least-significant to most (little endian). Okio uses the Le suffix for little-endian methods; methods without a suffix are big-endian. Signed vs. Unsigned. Java doesn\u2019t have unsigned primitive types (except for char !) so coping with this is often something that happens at the application layer. To make this a little easier Okio accepts int types for writeByte() and writeShort() . You can pass an \u201cunsigned\u201d byte like 255 and Okio will do the right thing. Method Width Endianness Value Encoded Value writeByte 1 3 03 writeShort 2 big 3 00 03 writeInt 4 big 3 00 00 00 03 writeLong 8 big 3 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 03 writeShortLe 2 little 3 03 00 writeIntLe 4 little 3 03 00 00 00 writeLongLe 8 little 3 03 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 writeByte 1 Byte.MAX_VALUE 7f writeShort 2 big Short.MAX_VALUE 7f ff writeInt 4 big Int.MAX_VALUE 7f ff ff ff writeLong 8 big Long.MAX_VALUE 7f ff ff ff ff ff ff ff writeShortLe 2 little Short.MAX_VALUE ff 7f writeIntLe 4 little Int.MAX_VALUE ff ff ff 7f writeLongLe 8 little Long.MAX_VALUE ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 7f This code encodes a bitmap following the BMP file format . void encode ( Bitmap bitmap , BufferedSink sink ) throws IOException { int height = bitmap . height (); int width = bitmap . width (); int bytesPerPixel = 3 ; int rowByteCountWithoutPadding = ( bytesPerPixel * width ); int rowByteCount = (( rowByteCountWithoutPadding + 3 ) / 4 ) * 4 ; int pixelDataSize = rowByteCount * height ; int bmpHeaderSize = 14 ; int dibHeaderSize = 40 ; // BMP Header sink . writeUtf8 ( \"BM\" ); // ID. sink . writeIntLe ( bmpHeaderSize + dibHeaderSize + pixelDataSize ); // File size. sink . writeShortLe ( 0 ); // Unused. sink . writeShortLe ( 0 ); // Unused. sink . writeIntLe ( bmpHeaderSize + dibHeaderSize ); // Offset of pixel data. // DIB Header sink . writeIntLe ( dibHeaderSize ); sink . writeIntLe ( width ); sink . writeIntLe ( height ); sink . writeShortLe ( 1 ); // Color plane count. sink . writeShortLe ( bytesPerPixel * Byte . SIZE ); sink . writeIntLe ( 0 ); // No compression. sink . writeIntLe ( 16 ); // Size of bitmap data including padding. sink . writeIntLe ( 2835 ); // Horizontal print resolution in pixels/meter. (72 dpi). sink . writeIntLe ( 2835 ); // Vertical print resolution in pixels/meter. (72 dpi). sink . writeIntLe ( 0 ); // Palette color count. sink . writeIntLe ( 0 ); // 0 important colors. // Pixel data. for ( int y = height - 1 ; y >= 0 ; y --) { for ( int x = 0 ; x < width ; x ++) { sink . writeByte ( bitmap . blue ( x , y )); sink . writeByte ( bitmap . green ( x , y )); sink . writeByte ( bitmap . red ( x , y )); } // Padding for 4-byte alignment. for ( int p = rowByteCountWithoutPadding ; p < rowByteCount ; p ++) { sink . writeByte ( 0 ); } } } The trickiest part of this program is the format\u2019s required padding. The BMP format expects each row to begin on a 4-byte boundary so it is necessary to add zeros to maintain the alignment. Encoding other binary formats is usually quite similar. Some tips: Write tests with golden values! Confirming that your program emits the expected result can make debugging easier. Use Utf8.size() to compute the number of bytes of an encoded string. This is essential for length-prefixed formats. Use Float.floatToIntBits() and Double.doubleToLongBits() to encode floating point values. Communicate on a Socket \u00b6 Sending and receiving data over the network is a bit like writing and reading files. We use BufferedSink to encode output and BufferedSource to decode input. Like files, network protocols can be text, binary, or a mix of both. But there are also some substantial differences between the network and the filesystem. With a file you\u2019re either reading or writing but with the network you can do both! Some protocols handle this by taking turns: write a request, read a response, repeat. You can implement this kind of protocol with a single thread. In other protocols you may read and write simultaneously. Typically you\u2019ll want one dedicated thread for reading. For writing you can use either a dedicated thread or use synchronized so that multiple threads can share a sink. Okio\u2019s streams are not safe for concurrent use. Sinks buffer outbound data to minimize I/O operations. This is efficient but it means you must manually call flush() to transmit data. Typically message-oriented protocols flush after each message. Note that Okio will automatically flush when the buffered data exceeds some threshold. This is intended to save memory and you shouldn\u2019t rely on it for interactive protocols. Okio builds on java.io.Socket for connectivity. Create your socket as a server or as a client, then use Okio.source(Socket) to read and Okio.sink(Socket) to write. These APIs also work with SSLSocket . You should use SSL unless you have a very good reason not to! Cancel a socket from any thread by calling Socket.close() ; this will cause its sources and sinks to immediately fail with an IOException . You can also configure timeouts for all socket operations. You don\u2019t need a reference to the socket to adjust timeouts: Source and Sink expose timeouts directly. This API works even if the streams are decorated. As a complete example of networking with Okio we wrote a basic SOCKS proxy server. Some highlights: Socket fromSocket = ... BufferedSource fromSource = Okio . buffer ( Okio . source ( fromSocket )); BufferedSink fromSink = Okio . buffer ( Okio . sink ( fromSocket )); Creating sources and sinks for sockets is the same as creating them for files. Once you create a Source or Sink for a socket you must not use its InputStream or OutputStream , respectively. Buffer buffer = new Buffer (); for ( long byteCount ; ( byteCount = source . read ( buffer , 8192L )) != - 1 ; ) { sink . write ( buffer , byteCount ); sink . flush (); } The above loop copies data from the source to the sink, flushing after each read. If we didn\u2019t need the flushing we could replace this loop with a single call to BufferedSink.writeAll(Source) . The 8192 argument to read() is the maximum number of bytes to read before returning. We could have passed any value here, but we like 8 KiB because that\u2019s the largest value Okio can do in a single system call. Most of the time application code doesn\u2019t need to deal with such limits! int addressType = fromSource . readByte () & 0xff ; int port = fromSource . readShort () & 0xffff ; Okio uses signed types like byte and short , but often protocols want unsigned values. The bitwise & operator is Java\u2019s preferred idiom to convert a signed value into an unsigned value. Here\u2019s a cheat sheet for bytes, shorts, and ints: Type Signed Range Unsigned Range Signed to Unsigned byte -128..127 0..255 int u = s & 0xff; short -32,768..32,767 0..65,535 int u = s & 0xffff; int -2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647 0..4,294,967,295 long u = s & 0xffffffffL; Java has no primitive type that can represent unsigned longs. Hashing \u00b6 We\u2019re bombarded by hashing in our lives as Java programmers. Early on we\u2019re introduced to the hashCode() method, something we know we need to override otherwise unforeseen bad things happen. Later we\u2019re shown LinkedHashMap and its friends. These build on that hashCode() method to organize data for fast retrieval. Elsewhere we have cryptographic hash functions. These get used all over the place. HTTPS certificates, Git commits, BitTorrent integrity checking, and Blockchain blocks all use cryptographic hashes. Good use of hashes can improve the performance, privacy, security, and simplicity of an application. Each cryptographic hash function accepts a variable-length stream of input bytes and produces a fixed-length byte string value called the \u201chash\u201d. Hash functions have these important qualities: Deterministic: each input always produces the same output. Uniform: each output byte string is equally likely. It is very difficult to find or create pairs of different inputs that yield the same output. This is called a \u201ccollision\u201d. Non-reversible: knowing an output doesn\u2019t help you to find the input. Note that if you know some possible inputs you can hash them to see if their hashes match. Well-known: the hash is implemented everywhere and rigorously understood. Good hash functions are very cheap to compute (dozens of microseconds) and expensive to reverse (quintillions of millenia). Steady advances in computing and mathematics have caused once-great hash functions to become inexpensive to reverse. When choosing a hash function, beware that not all are created equal! Okio supports these well-known cryptographic hash functions: MD5 : a 128-bit (16 byte) cryptographic hash. It is both insecure and obsolete because it is inexpensive to reverse! This hash is offered because it is popular and convenient for use in legacy systems that are not security-sensitive. SHA-1 : a 160-bit (20 byte) cryptographic hash. It was recently demonstrated that it is feasible to create SHA-1 collisions. Consider upgrading from SHA-1 to SHA-256. SHA-256 : a 256-bit (32 byte) cryptographic hash. SHA-256 is widely understood and expensive to reverse. This is the hash most systems should use. SHA-512 : a 512-bit (64 byte) cryptographic hash. It is expensive to reverse. Each hash creates a ByteString of the specified length. Use hex() to get the conventional human-readable form. Or leave it as a ByteString because that\u2019s a convenient model type! Okio can produce cryptographic hashes from byte strings: ByteString byteString = readByteString(new File(\"README.md\")); System.out.println(\" md5: \" + byteString.md5().hex()); System.out.println(\" sha1: \" + byteString.sha1().hex()); System.out.println(\"sha256: \" + byteString.sha256().hex()); System.out.println(\"sha512: \" + byteString.sha512().hex()); From buffers: Buffer buffer = readBuffer(new File(\"README.md\")); System.out.println(\" md5: \" + buffer.md5().hex()); System.out.println(\" sha1: \" + buffer.sha1().hex()); System.out.println(\"sha256: \" + buffer.sha256().hex()); System.out.println(\"sha512: \" + buffer.sha512().hex()); While streaming from a source: try (HashingSink hashingSink = HashingSink.sha256(Okio.blackhole()); BufferedSource source = Okio.buffer(Okio.source(file))) { source.readAll(hashingSink); System.out.println(\"sha256: \" + hashingSink.hash().hex()); } While streaming to a sink: try (HashingSink hashingSink = HashingSink.sha256(Okio.blackhole()); BufferedSink sink = Okio.buffer(hashingSink); Source source = Okio.source(file)) { sink.writeAll(source); sink.close(); // Emit anything buffered. System.out.println(\"sha256: \" + hashingSink.hash().hex()); } Okio also supports HMAC (Hash Message Authentication Code) which combines a secret and a hash. Applications use HMAC for data integrity and authentication. ByteString secret = ByteString.decodeHex(\"7065616e7574627574746572\"); System.out.println(\"hmacSha256: \" + byteString.hmacSha256(secret).hex()); As with hashing, you can generate an HMAC from a ByteString , Buffer , HashingSource , and HashingSink . Note that Okio doesn\u2019t implement HMAC for MD5. Okio uses Java\u2019s java.security.MessageDigest for cryptographic hashes and javax.crypto.Mac for HMAC.

Here we use Java\u2019s try blocks to close our sources automatically. public void readLines ( File file ) throws IOException { try ( Source fileSource = Okio . source ( file ); BufferedSource bufferedSource = Okio . buffer ( fileSource )) { while ( true ) { String line = bufferedSource . readUtf8Line (); if ( line == null ) break ; if ( line . contains ( \"square\" )) { System . out . println ( line ); } } } } The readUtf8Line() API reads all of the data until the next line delimiter \u2013 either \\n , \\r\\n , or the end of the file. It returns that data as a string, omitting the delimiter at the end. When it encounters empty lines the method will return an empty string. If there isn\u2019t any more data to read it will return null. The above program can be written more compactly by inlining the fileSource variable and by using a fancy for loop instead of a while : public void readLines ( File file ) throws IOException { try ( BufferedSource source = Okio . buffer ( Okio . source ( file ))) { for ( String line ; ( line = source . readUtf8Line ()) != null ; ) { if ( line . contains ( \"square\" )) { System . out . println ( line ); } } } } The readUtf8Line() method is suitable for parsing most files. For certain use-cases you may also consider readUtf8LineStrict() . It is similar but it requires that each line is terminated by \\n or \\r\\n . If it encounters the end of the file before that it will throw an EOFException . The strict variant also permits a byte limit to defend against malformed input. public void readLines ( File file ) throws IOException { try ( BufferedSource source = Okio . buffer ( Okio . source ( file ))) { while (! source . exhausted ()) { String line = source . readUtf8LineStrict ( 1024L ); if ( line . contains ( \"square\" )) { System . out . println ( line ); } } } }","title":"Read a text file line-by-line"},{"location":"#write-a-text-file","text":"Above we used a Source and a BufferedSource to read a file. To write, we use a Sink and a BufferedSink . The advantages of buffering are the same: a more capable API and better performance. public void writeEnv ( File file ) throws IOException { try ( Sink fileSink = Okio . sink ( file ); BufferedSink bufferedSink = Okio . buffer ( fileSink )) { for ( Map . Entry < String , String > entry : System . getenv (). entrySet ()) { bufferedSink . writeUtf8 ( entry . getKey ()); bufferedSink . writeUtf8 ( \"=\" ); bufferedSink . writeUtf8 ( entry . getValue ()); bufferedSink . writeUtf8 ( \"\\n\" ); } } } There isn\u2019t an API to write a line of input; instead we manually insert our own newline character. Most programs should hardcode \"\\n\" as the newline character. In rare situations you may use System.lineSeparator() instead of \"\\n\" : it returns \"\\r\\n\" on Windows and \"\\n\" everywhere else. We can write the above program more compactly by inlining the fileSink variable and by taking advantage of method chaining: public void writeEnv ( File file ) throws IOException { try ( BufferedSink sink = Okio . buffer ( Okio . sink ( file ))) { for ( Map . Entry < String , String > entry : System . getenv (). entrySet ()) { sink . writeUtf8 ( entry . getKey ()) . writeUtf8 ( \"=\" ) . writeUtf8 ( entry . getValue ()) . writeUtf8 ( \"\\n\" ); } } } In the above code we make four calls to writeUtf8() . Making four calls is more efficient than the code below because the VM doesn\u2019t have to create and garbage collect a temporary string. sink . writeUtf8 ( entry . getKey () + \"=\" + entry . getValue () + \"\\n\" ); // Slower!","title":"Write a text file"},{"location":"#utf-8","text":"In the above APIs you can see that Okio really likes UTF-8. Early computer systems suffered many incompatible character encodings: ISO-8859-1, ShiftJIS, ASCII, EBCDIC, etc. Writing software to support multiple character sets was awful and we didn\u2019t even have emoji! Today we\u2019re lucky that the world has standardized on UTF-8 everywhere, with some rare uses of other charsets in legacy systems. If you need another character set, readString() and writeString() are there for you. These methods require that you specify a character set. Otherwise you may accidentally create data that is only readable by the local computer. Most programs should use the UTF-8 methods only. When encoding strings you need to be mindful of the different ways that strings are represented and encoded. When a glyph has an accent or another adornment it may be represented as a single complex code point ( \u00e9 ) or as a simple code point ( e ) followed by its modifiers ( \u00b4 ). When the entire glyph is a single code point that\u2019s called NFC ; when it\u2019s multiple it\u2019s NFD . Though we use UTF-8 whenever we read or write strings in I/O, when they are in memory Java Strings use an obsolete character encoding called UTF-16. It is a bad encoding because it uses a 16-bit char for most characters, but some don\u2019t fit. In particular, most emoji use two Java chars. This is problematic because String.length() returns a surprising result: the number of UTF-16 chars and not the natural number of glyphs.

But when you need them, there are convenient APIs for dealing with low-level UTF-8 strings. Use Utf8.size() to count the number of bytes required to encode a string as UTF-8 without actually encoding it. This is handy in length-prefixed encodings like protocol buffers. Use BufferedSource.readUtf8CodePoint() to read a single variable-length code point, and BufferedSink.writeUtf8CodePoint() to write one.","title":"UTF-8"},{"location":"#golden-values","text":"Okio likes testing. The library itself is heavily tested, and it has features that are often helpful when testing application code. One pattern we\u2019ve found to be quite useful is \u201cgolden value\u201d testing. The goal of such tests is to confirm that data encoded with earlier versions of a program can safely be decoded by the current program. We\u2019ll illustrate this by encoding a value using Java Serialization. Though we must disclaim that Java Serialization is an awful encoding system and most programs should prefer other formats like JSON or protobuf! In any case, here\u2019s a method that takes an object, serializes it, and returns the result as a ByteString : private ByteString serialize ( Object o ) throws IOException { Buffer buffer = new Buffer (); try ( ObjectOutputStream objectOut = new ObjectOutputStream ( buffer . outputStream ())) { objectOut . writeObject ( o ); } return buffer . readByteString (); } There\u2019s a lot going on here. We create a buffer as a holding space for our serialized data. It\u2019s a convenient replacement for ByteArrayOutputStream . We ask the buffer for its output stream. Writes to a buffer or its output stream always append data to the end of the buffer. We create an ObjectOutputStream (the encoding API for Java serialization) and write our object. The try block takes care of closing the stream for us. Note that closing a buffer has no effect. Finally we read a byte string from the buffer. The readByteString() method allows us to specify how many bytes to read; here we don\u2019t specify a count in order to read the entire thing. Reads from a buffer always consume data from the front of the buffer. With our serialize() method handy we are ready to compute and print a golden value. Point point = new Point ( 8.0 , 15.0 ); ByteString pointBytes = serialize ( point ); System . out . println ( pointBytes . base64 ()); We print the ByteString as base64 because it\u2019s a compact format that\u2019s suitable for embedding in a test case. The program prints this: rO0ABXNyAB5va2lvLnNhbXBsZXMuR29sZGVuVmFsdWUkUG9pbnTdUW8rMji1IwIAAkQAAXhEAAF5eHBAIAAAAAAAAEAuAAAAAAAA That\u2019s our golden value! We can embed it in our test case using base64 again to convert it back into a ByteString : ByteString goldenBytes = ByteString . decodeBase64 ( \"rO0ABXNyAB5va2lvLnNhbXBsZ\" + \"XMuR29sZGVuVmFsdWUkUG9pbnTdUW8rMji1IwIAAkQAAXhEAAF5eHBAIAAAAAAAAEAuA\" + \"AAAAAAA\" ); The next step is to deserialize the ByteString back into our value class. This method reverses the serialize() method above: we append a byte string to a buffer then consume it using an ObjectInputStream : private Object deserialize ( ByteString byteString ) throws IOException , ClassNotFoundException { Buffer buffer = new Buffer (); buffer . write ( byteString ); try ( ObjectInputStream objectIn = new ObjectInputStream ( buffer . inputStream ())) { return objectIn . readObject (); } } Now we can test the decoder against the golden value: ByteString goldenBytes = ByteString . decodeBase64 ( \"rO0ABXNyAB5va2lvLnNhbXBsZ\" + \"XMuR29sZGVuVmFsdWUkUG9pbnTdUW8rMji1IwIAAkQAAXhEAAF5eHBAIAAAAAAAAEAuA\" + \"AAAAAAA\" ); Point decoded = ( Point ) deserialize ( goldenBytes ); assertEquals ( new Point ( 8.0 , 15.0 ), decoded ); With this test we can change the serialization of the Point class without breaking compatibility.","title":"Golden Values"},{"location":"#write-a-binary-file","text":"Encoding a binary file is not unlike encoding a text file. Okio uses the same BufferedSink and BufferedSource bytes for both. This is handy for binary formats that include both byte and character data. Writing binary data is more hazardous than text because if you make a mistake it is often quite difficult to diagnose. Avoid such mistakes by being careful around these traps: The width of each field. This is the number of bytes used. Okio doesn\u2019t include a mechanism to emit partial bytes. If you need that, you\u2019ll need to do your own bit shifting and masking before writing. The endianness of each field. All fields that have more than one byte have endianness : whether the bytes are ordered most-significant to least (big endian) or least-significant to most (little endian). Okio uses the Le suffix for little-endian methods; methods without a suffix are big-endian. Signed vs. Unsigned. Java doesn\u2019t have unsigned primitive types (except for char !) so coping with this is often something that happens at the application layer. To make this a little easier Okio accepts int types for writeByte() and writeShort() . You can pass an \u201cunsigned\u201d byte like 255 and Okio will do the right thing.

The BMP format expects each row to begin on a 4-byte boundary so it is necessary to add zeros to maintain the alignment. Encoding other binary formats is usually quite similar. Some tips: Write tests with golden values! Confirming that your program emits the expected result can make debugging easier. Use Utf8.size() to compute the number of bytes of an encoded string. This is essential for length-prefixed formats. Use Float.floatToIntBits() and Double.doubleToLongBits() to encode floating point values.","title":"Write a binary file"},{"location":"#communicate-on-a-socket","text":"Sending and receiving data over the network is a bit like writing and reading files. We use BufferedSink to encode output and BufferedSource to decode input. Like files, network protocols can be text, binary, or a mix of both. But there are also some substantial differences between the network and the filesystem. With a file you\u2019re either reading or writing but with the network you can do both! Some protocols handle this by taking turns: write a request, read a response, repeat. You can implement this kind of protocol with a single thread. In other protocols you may read and write simultaneously. Typically you\u2019ll want one dedicated thread for reading. For writing you can use either a dedicated thread or use synchronized so that multiple threads can share a sink. Okio\u2019s streams are not safe for concurrent use. Sinks buffer outbound data to minimize I/O operations. This is efficient but it means you must manually call flush() to transmit data. Typically message-oriented protocols flush after each message. Note that Okio will automatically flush when the buffered data exceeds some threshold. This is intended to save memory and you shouldn\u2019t rely on it for interactive protocols. Okio builds on java.io.Socket for connectivity. Create your socket as a server or as a client, then use Okio.source(Socket) to read and Okio.sink(Socket) to write. These APIs also work with SSLSocket . You should use SSL unless you have a very good reason not to! Cancel a socket from any thread by calling Socket.close() ; this will cause its sources and sinks to immediately fail with an IOException . You can also configure timeouts for all socket operations. You don\u2019t need a reference to the socket to adjust timeouts: Source and Sink expose timeouts directly. This API works even if the streams are decorated. As a complete example of networking with Okio we wrote a basic SOCKS proxy server. Some highlights: Socket fromSocket = ... BufferedSource fromSource = Okio . buffer ( Okio . source ( fromSocket )); BufferedSink fromSink = Okio . buffer ( Okio . sink ( fromSocket )); Creating sources and sinks for sockets is the same as creating them for files. Once you create a Source or Sink for a socket you must not use its InputStream or OutputStream , respectively. Buffer buffer = new Buffer (); for ( long byteCount ; ( byteCount = source . read ( buffer , 8192L )) != - 1 ; ) { sink . write ( buffer , byteCount ); sink . flush (); } The above loop copies data from the source to the sink, flushing after each read. If we didn\u2019t need the flushing we could replace this loop with a single call to BufferedSink.writeAll(Source) . The 8192 argument to read() is the maximum number of bytes to read before returning. We could have passed any value here, but we like 8 KiB because that\u2019s the largest value Okio can do in a single system call. Most of the time application code doesn\u2019t need to deal with such limits! int addressType = fromSource . readByte () & 0xff ; int port = fromSource . readShort () & 0xffff ; Okio uses signed types like byte and short , but often protocols want unsigned values. The bitwise & operator is Java\u2019s preferred idiom to convert a signed value into an unsigned value. Here\u2019s a cheat sheet for bytes, shorts, and ints: Type Signed Range Unsigned Range Signed to Unsigned byte -128..127 0..255 int u = s & 0xff; short -32,768..32,767 0..65,535 int u = s & 0xffff; int -2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647 0..4,294,967,295 long u = s & 0xffffffffL; Java has no primitive type that can represent unsigned longs.","title":"Communicate on a Socket"},{"location":"#hashing","text":"We\u2019re bombarded by hashing in our lives as Java programmers. Early on we\u2019re introduced to the hashCode() method, something we know we need to override otherwise unforeseen bad things happen. Later we\u2019re shown LinkedHashMap and its friends. These build on that hashCode() method to organize data for fast retrieval. Elsewhere we have cryptographic hash functions. These get used all over the place. HTTPS certificates, Git commits, BitTorrent integrity checking, and Blockchain blocks all use cryptographic hashes. Good use of hashes can improve the performance, privacy, security, and simplicity of an application. Each cryptographic hash function accepts a variable-length stream of input bytes and produces a fixed-length byte string value called the \u201chash\u201d. Hash functions have these important qualities: Deterministic: each input always produces the same output. Uniform: each output byte string is equally likely. It is very difficult to find or create pairs of different inputs that yield the same output. This is called a \u201ccollision\u201d. Non-reversible: knowing an output doesn\u2019t help you to find the input. Note that if you know some possible inputs you can hash them to see if their hashes match. Well-known: the hash is implemented everywhere and rigorously understood. Good hash functions are very cheap to compute (dozens of microseconds) and expensive to reverse (quintillions of millenia). Steady advances in computing and mathematics have caused once-great hash functions to become inexpensive to reverse. When choosing a hash function, beware that not all are created equal! Okio supports these well-known cryptographic hash functions: MD5 : a 128-bit (16 byte) cryptographic hash. It is both insecure and obsolete because it is inexpensive to reverse! This hash is offered because it is popular and convenient for use in legacy systems that are not security-sensitive. SHA-1 : a 160-bit (20 byte) cryptographic hash. It was recently demonstrated that it is feasible to create SHA-1 collisions. Consider upgrading from SHA-1 to SHA-256. SHA-256 : a 256-bit (32 byte) cryptographic hash. SHA-256 is widely understood and expensive to reverse. This is the hash most systems should use. SHA-512 : a 512-bit (64 byte) cryptographic hash. It is expensive to reverse. Each hash creates a ByteString of the specified length. Use hex() to get the conventional human-readable form. Or leave it as a ByteString because that\u2019s a convenient model type! Okio can produce cryptographic hashes from byte strings: ByteString byteString = readByteString(new File(\"README.md\")); System.out.println(\" md5: \" + byteString.md5().hex()); System.out.println(\" sha1: \" + byteString.sha1().hex()); System.out.println(\"sha256: \" + byteString.sha256().hex()); System.out.println(\"sha512: \" + byteString.sha512().hex()); From buffers: Buffer buffer = readBuffer(new File(\"README.md\")); System.out.println(\" md5: \" + buffer.md5().hex()); System.out.println(\" sha1: \" + buffer.sha1().hex()); System.out.println(\"sha256: \" + buffer.sha256().hex()); System.out.println(\"sha512: \" + buffer.sha512().hex()); While streaming from a source: try (HashingSink hashingSink = HashingSink.sha256(Okio.blackhole()); BufferedSource source = Okio.buffer(Okio.source(file))) { source.readAll(hashingSink); System.out.println(\"sha256: \" + hashingSink.hash().hex()); } While streaming to a sink: try (HashingSink hashingSink = HashingSink.sha256(Okio.blackhole()); BufferedSink sink = Okio.buffer(hashingSink); Source source = Okio.source(file)) { sink.writeAll(source); sink.close(); // Emit anything buffered. System.out.println(\"sha256: \" + hashingSink.hash().hex()); } Okio also supports HMAC (Hash Message Authentication Code) which combines a secret and a hash. Applications use HMAC for data integrity and authentication. ByteString secret = ByteString.decodeHex(\"7065616e7574627574746572\"); System.out.println(\"hmacSha256: \" + byteString.hmacSha256(secret).hex()); As with hashing, you can generate an HMAC from a ByteString , Buffer , HashingSource , and HashingSink .

We\u2019ve also added APIs to ease migration for Kotlin users. They use Kotlin\u2019s @Deprecated annotation to help you change call sites from the 1.x style to the 2.x style. Version 2.0.0-RC1 \u00b6 2018-07-26 Okio 2 is a major release that upgrades the library\u2019s implementation language from Java to Kotlin. Okio 2.x is binary-compatible with Okio 1.x and does not change any behavior. Classes and .jar files compiled against 1.x can be used with 2.x without recompiling. Okio 2.x is .java source compatible with Okio 1.x in all but one corner case. In Okio 1.x Buffer would throw an unchecked IllegalStateException when attempting to read more bytes than available. Okio 2.x now throws a checked EOFException in this case. This is now consistent with the behavior of its BufferedSource interface. Java callers that don\u2019t already catch IOException will now need to. Okio 2.x is .kt source-incompatible with Okio 1.x. This release adopts Kotlin idioms where they are available.

We benchmarked both versions to find potential performance regressions. We found one regression and fixed it: we were using == instead of === . Other changes in this release: New: Add a dependency on kotlin-stdlib. Okio\u2019s transitive dependencies grow from none in 1.x to three in 2.x. These are kotlin-stdlib (939 KiB), kotlin-stdlib-common (104 KiB), and JetBrains\u2019 annotations (17 KiB). New: Change Okio to build with Gradle instead of Maven. Version 1.15.0 \u00b6 2018-07-18 New: Trie-based Buffer.select() . This improves performance when selecting among large lists of options. Fix: Retain interrupted state when throwing InterruptedIOException . Version 1.14.0 \u00b6 2018-02-11 New: Buffer.UnsafeCursor provides direct access to Okio internals. This API is like Okio\u2019s version of Java reflection: it\u2019s a very powerful API that can be used for great things and dangerous things alike. The documentation is extensive and anyone using it should review it carefully before proceeding! New: Change BufferedSource to implement java.nio.ReadableByteChannel and BufferedSink to implement java.nio.WritableByteChannel . Now it\u2019s a little easier to interop between Okio and NIO. New: Automatic module name of okio for use with the Java Platform Module System. New: Optimize Buffer.getByte() to search backwards when doing so will be more efficient. Fix: Honor the requested byte count in InflaterSource . Previously this class could return more bytes than requested. Fix: Improve a performance bug in AsyncTimeout.sink().write() . Version 1.13.0 \u00b6 2017-05-12 Okio now uses @Nullable to annotate all possibly-null values. We\u2019ve added a compile-time dependency on the JSR 305 annotations. This is a provided dependency and does not need to be included in your build configuration, .jar file, or .apk . We use @ParametersAreNonnullByDefault and all parameters and return types are never null unless explicitly annotated @Nullable . Warning: this release is source-incompatible for Kotlin users. Nullability was previously ambiguous and lenient but now the compiler will enforce strict null checks. Version 1.12.0 \u00b6 2017-04-11 Fix: Change Pipe\u2019s sink.flush() to not block. Previously closing a pipe\u2019s sink would block until the source had been exhausted. In practice this blocked the caller for no benefit. Fix: Change writeUtf8CodePoint() to emit ? for partial surrogates. The previous behavior was inconsistent: given a malformed string with a partial surrogate, writeUtf8() emitted ? but writeUtf8CodePoint() threw an IllegalArgumentException . Most applications will never encounter partial surrogates, but for those that do this behavior was unexpected. New: Allow length of readUtf8LineStrict() to be limited. New: Utf8.size() method to get the number of bytes required to encode a string as UTF-8. This may be useful for length-prefixed encodings. New: SHA-512 hash and HMAC APIs. Version 1.11.0 \u00b6 2016-10-11 Fix: The four-argument overload of Buffer.writeString() had a major bug where it didn\u2019t respect offsets if the specified charset was UTF-8. This was because our short-circuit optimization omitted necessary offset parameters. New: HMAC support in HashingSource , HashingSink , ByteString , and Buffer . This makes it easy to create a keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) wherever your data is. Unlike the other hashes, HMAC uses a ByteString secret key for authentication. New: ByteString.of(ByteBuffer) makes it easier to mix NIO with Okio. Version 1.10.0 \u00b6 2016-08-28 Fix: Support reading files larger than 2 GiB with GzipSource . Previously attempting to decompress such files would fail due to an overflow when validating the total length. Fix: Exit the watchdog thread after being idle for 60 seconds. This should make it possible for class unloaders to fully unload Okio. New: Okio.blackhole() returns a sink where all bytes written are discarded. This is Okio\u2019s equivalent of /dev/null . New: Encode a string with any charset using ByteString.encodeString() and decode strings in any charset using ByteString.string() . Most applications should prefer ByteString.encodeUtf8() and ByteString.utf8() unless it\u2019s necessary to support a legacy charset. New: GzipSink.deflater() makes it possible to configure the compression level. Version 1.9.0 \u00b6 2016-07-01 New: Pipe makes it easy to connect a producer thread to a consumer thread. Reads block until data is available to read. Writes block if the pipe\u2019s is full. Both sources and sinks support timeouts. New: BufferedSource.rangeEquals() makes it easy to compare a range in a stream to an expected value. This does the right thing: it blocks to load the data required return a definitive result. But it won\u2019t block unnecessarily. New: Timeout.waitUntilNotified() makes it possible to use nice timeout abstractions on Java\u2019s built-in wait/notify primitives. Fix: Don\u2019t return incorrect results when HashingSource does large reads. There was a bug where it wasn\u2019t traversing through the segments of the buffer being hashed. This means that HashingSource was returning incorrect answers for any writes that spanned multiple segment boundaries. Version 1.8.0 \u00b6 2016-05-02 New: BufferedSource.select(Options) API for reading one of a set of expected values. New: Make ByteString.toString() and Buffer.toString() friendlier. These methods return text if the byte string is valid UTF-8. New: APIs to match byte strings: indexOf() , startsWith() , and endsWith() . Version 1.7.0 \u00b6 2016-04-10 New: Change the segment size to 8 KiB. This has been reported to dramatically improve performance in some applications. New: md5() , sha1() , and sha256() methods on Buffer . Also add a sha1() method on ByteString for symmetry. New: HashingSource and HashingSink . These classes are Okio\u2019s equivalent to the JDK\u2019s DigestInputStream and DigestOutputStream . They offer convenient md5() , sha1() , and sha256() factory methods to avoid an impossible NoSuchAlgorithmException . New: ByteString.asByteBuffer() . Fix: Limit snapshot byte strings to requested size. Fix: Change write timeouts to have a maximum write size. Previously large writes could easly suffer timeouts because the entire write was subject to a single timeout. Fix: Recover from EBADF failures, which could be triggered by asynchronously closing a stream on older versions of Android. Fix: Don\u2019t share segments if doing so only saves a small copy. This should improve performance for all applications. Fix: Optimize BufferedSource.indexOfElement() and indexOf(ByteString) . Previously this method had a bug that caused it to be very slow on large buffers. Version 1.6.0 \u00b6 2015-08-25 New: BufferedSource.indexOf(ByteString) searches a source for the next occurrence of a byte string. Fix: Recover from unexpected AssertionError thrown on Android 4.2.2 and earlier when asynchronously closing a socket. Version 1.5.0 \u00b6 2015-06-19 Sockets streams now throw SocketTimeoutException . This builds on new extension point in AsyncTimeout to customize the exception when a timeout occurs. New: ByteString now implements Comparable . The comparison sorts bytes as unsigned: {@code ff} sorts after {@code 00}. Version 1.4.0 \u00b6 2015-05-16 Timeout exception changed. Previously Timeout.throwIfReached() would throw InterruptedIOException on thread interruption, and IOException if the deadline was reached. Now it throws InterruptedIOException in both cases. Fix: throw EOFException when attempting to read digits from an empty source. Previously this would crash with an unchecked exception. New: APIs to read and write UTF-8 code points without allocating strings. New: BufferedSink can now write substrings directly, potentially saving an allocation for some callers. New: ForwardingTimeout class. Version 1.3.0 \u00b6 2015-03-16 New: Read and write signed decimal and unsigned hexadecimal values in BufferedSource and BufferedSink . Unlike the alternatives, these methods don\u2019t do any memory allocations! New: Segment sharing. This improves the runtime of operations like Buffer.clone() and Buffer.copyTo() by sharing underlying segments between buffers. New: Buffer.snapshot() returns an immutable snapshot of a buffer as a ByteString . This builds on segment sharing so that snapshots are shallow, immutable copies. New: ByteString.rangeEquals() . New: ByteString.md5() and ByteString.sha256() . New: ByteString.base64Url() returns URL-safe Base64. The existing decoding method has been extended to support URL-safe Base64 input. New: ByteString.substring() returns a prefix, infix, or suffix. New: Sink now implements java.io.Flushable . Fix: Buffer.write(Source, long) now always writes fully. The previous behavior would return as soon as any data had been written; this was inconsistent with all other write() methods in the API. Fix: don\u2019t leak empty segments in DeflaterSink and InflaterSource. (This was unlikely to cause problems in practice.) Version 1.2.0 \u00b6 2014-12-30 Fix: Okio.buffer() always buffers for better predictability. Fix: Provide context when readUtf8LineStrict() throws. Fix: Buffers do not call through the Source on zero-byte writes. Version 1.1.0 \u00b6 2014-12-11 Do UTF-8 encoding natively for a performance increase, particularly on Android. New APIs: BufferedSink.emit() , BufferedSource.request() and BufferedSink.indexOfElement() . Fixed a performance bug in Buffer.indexOf() Version 1.0.1 \u00b6 2014-08-08 Added read(byte[]) , read(byte[], offset, byteCount) , and void readFully(byte[]) to BufferedSource . Refined declared checked exceptions on Buffer methods. Version 1.0.0 \u00b6 2014-05-23 Bumped release version. No other changes! Version 0.9.0 \u00b6 2014-05-03 Use 0 as a sentinel for no timeout. Make AsyncTimeout public. Remove checked exception from Buffer.readByteArray. Version 0.8.0 \u00b6 2014-04-24 Eagerly verify preconditions on public APIs. Quick return on Buffer instance equivalence. Add delegate types for Sink and Source. Small changes to the way deadlines are managed. Add append variant of Okio.sink for File. Methods to exhaust BufferedSource to byte[] and ByteString. Version 0.7.0 \u00b6 2014-04-18 Don\u2019t use getters in timeout. Use the watchdog to interrupt sockets that have reached deadlines. Add java.io and java.nio file source/sink helpers. Version 0.6.1 \u00b6 2014-04-17 Methods to read a buffered source fully in UTF-8 or supplied charset. API to read a byte[] directly. New methods to move all data from a source to a sink. Fix a bug on input stream exhaustion. Version 0.6.0 \u00b6 2014-04-15 Make ByteString serializable. New API: ByteString.of(byte[] data, int offset, int byteCount) New API: stream-based copy, write, and read helpers. Version 0.5.0 \u00b6 2014-04-08 Initial public release.

New: Buffer.snapshot() returns an immutable snapshot of a buffer as a ByteString . This builds on segment sharing so that snapshots are shallow, immutable copies. New: ByteString.rangeEquals() . New: ByteString.md5() and ByteString.sha256() . New: ByteString.base64Url() returns URL-safe Base64. The existing decoding method has been extended to support URL-safe Base64 input. New: ByteString.substring() returns a prefix, infix, or suffix. New: Sink now implements java.io.Flushable . Fix: Buffer.write(Source, long) now always writes fully. The previous behavior would return as soon as any data had been written; this was inconsistent with all other write() methods in the API. Fix: don\u2019t leak empty segments in DeflaterSink and InflaterSource.

UnsafeCursor : Closeable A handle to the underlying data in a buffer. This handle is unsafe because it does not enforce its own invariants. Instead, it assumes a careful user who has studied Okio\u2019s implementation details and their consequences. Buffer Internals Most code should use Buffer as a black box: a class that holds 0 or more bytes of data with efficient APIs to append data to the end and to consume data from the front. Usually this is also the most efficient way to use buffers because it allows Okio to employ several optimizations, including: Fast Allocation: Buffers use a shared pool of memory that is not zero-filled before use. Fast Resize: A buffer\u2019s capacity can change without copying its contents. Fast Move: Memory ownership can be reassigned from one buffer to another. Fast Copy: Multiple buffers can share the same underlying memory. Fast Encoding and Decoding: Common operations like UTF-8 encoding and decimal decoding do not require intermediate objects to be allocated. These optimizations all leverage the way Okio stores data internally. Okio Buffers are implemented using a doubly-linked list of segments. Each segment is a contiguous range within a 8 KiB ByteArray . Each segment has two indexes, start , the offset of the first byte of the array containing application data, and end , the offset of the first byte beyond start whose data is undefined. New buffers are empty and have no segments: val buffer = Buffer() We append 7 bytes of data to the end of our empty buffer. Internally, the buffer allocates a segment and writes its new data there. The lone segment has an 8 KiB byte array but only 7 bytes of data: buffer.writeUtf8(\"sealion\") // [ 's', 'e', 'a', 'l', 'i', 'o', 'n', '?', '?', '?', ...] // ^ ^ // start = 0 end = 7 When we read 4 bytes of data from the buffer, it finds its first segment and returns that data to us. As bytes are read the data is consumed. The segment tracks this by adjusting its internal indices. buffer.readUtf8(4) // \"seal\" // [ 's', 'e', 'a', 'l', 'i', 'o', 'n', '?', '?', '?', ...] // ^ ^ // start = 4 end = 7 As we write data into a buffer we fill up its internal segments. When a write doesn\u2019t fit into a buffer\u2019s last segment, additional segments are allocated and appended to the linked list of segments. Each segment has its own start and end indexes tracking where the user\u2019s data begins and ends. val xoxo = new Buffer() xoxo.writeUtf8(\"xo\".repeat(5_000)) // [ 'x', 'o', 'x', 'o', 'x', 'o', 'x', 'o', ..., 'x', 'o', 'x', 'o'] // ^ ^ // start = 0 end = 8192 // // [ 'x', 'o', 'x', 'o', ..., 'x', 'o', 'x', 'o', '?', '?', '?', ...] // ^ ^ // start = 0 end = 1808 The start index is always inclusive and the end index is always exclusive . The data preceding the start index is undefined, and the data at and following the end index is undefined. After the last byte of a segment has been read, that segment may be returned to an internal segment pool. In addition to reducing the need to do garbage collection, segment pooling also saves the JVM from needing to zero-fill byte arrays. Okio doesn\u2019t need to zero-fill its arrays because it always writes memory before it reads it. But if you look at a segment in a debugger you may see its effects. In this example, one of the \u201cxoxo\u201d segments above is reused in an unrelated buffer: val abc = new Buffer() abc.writeUtf8(\"abc\") // [ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'o', 'x', 'o', 'x', 'o', ...] // ^ ^ // start = 0 end = 3 There is an optimization in Buffer.clone() and other methods that allows two segments to share the same underlying byte array. Clones can\u2019t write to the shared byte array; instead they allocate a new (private) segment early. val nana = new Buffer() nana.writeUtf8(\"na\".repeat(2_500)) nana.readUtf8(2) // \"na\" // [ 'n', 'a', 'n', 'a', ..., 'n', 'a', 'n', 'a', '?', '?', '?', ...] // ^ ^ // start = 2 end = 5000 nana2 = nana.clone() nana2.writeUtf8(\"batman\") // [ 'n', 'a', 'n', 'a', ..., 'n', 'a', 'n', 'a', '?', '?', '?', ...] // ^ ^ // start = 2 end = 5000 // // [ 'b', 'a', 't', 'm', 'a', 'n', '?', '?', '?', ...] // ^ ^ // start = 0 end = 6 Segments are not shared when the shared region is small (ie. less than 1 KiB). This is intended to prevent fragmentation in sharing-heavy use cases. Unsafe Cursor API This class exposes privileged access to the internal byte arrays of a buffer. A cursor either references the data of a single segment, it is before the first segment ( offset == -1 ), or it is after the last segment ( offset == buffer.size ). Call UnsafeCursor.seek to move the cursor to the segment that contains a specified offset. After seeking, UnsafeCursor.data references the segment\u2019s internal byte array, UnsafeCursor.start is the segment\u2019s start and UnsafeCursor.end is its end. Call UnsafeCursor.next to advance the cursor to the next segment. This returns -1 if there are no further segments in the buffer. Use Buffer.readUnsafe to create a cursor to read buffer data and Buffer.readAndWriteUnsafe to create a cursor to read and write buffer data. In either case, always call UnsafeCursor.close when done with a cursor. This is convenient with Kotlin\u2019s use extension function. In this example we read all of the bytes in a buffer into a byte array: val bufferBytes = ByteArray(buffer.size.toInt()) buffer.readUnsafe().use { cursor -> while (cursor.next() != -1) { System.arraycopy(cursor.data, cursor.start, bufferBytes, cursor.offset.toInt(), cursor.end - cursor.start); } } Change the capacity of a buffer with resizeBuffer . This is only permitted for read+write cursors. The buffer\u2019s size always changes from the end: shrinking it removes bytes from the end; growing it adds capacity to the end. Warnings Most application developers should avoid this API. Those that must use this API should respect these warnings. Don\u2019t mutate a cursor. This class has public, non-final fields because that is convenient for low-level I/O frameworks. Never assign values to these fields; instead use the cursor API to adjust these. Never mutate data unless you have read+write access. You are on the honor system to never write the buffer in read-only mode. Read-only mode may be more efficient than read+write mode because it does not need to make private copies of shared segments. Only access data in [start..end) . Other data in the byte array is undefined! It may contain private or sensitive data from other parts of your process. Always fill the new capacity when you grow a buffer. New capacity is not zero-filled and may contain data from other parts of your process. Avoid leaking this information by always writing something to the newly-allocated capacity. Do not assume that new capacity will be filled with 0 ; it will not be. Do not access a buffer while is being accessed by a cursor. Even simple read-only operations like Buffer.clone are unsafe because they mark segments as shared. Do not hard-code the segment size in your application. It is possible that segment sizes will change with advances in hardware. Future versions of Okio may even have heterogeneous segment sizes. These warnings are intended to help you to use this API safely. It\u2019s here for developers that need absolutely the most throughput. Since that\u2019s you, here\u2019s one final performance tip. You can reuse instances of this class if you like. Use the overloads of Buffer.readUnsafe and Buffer.readAndWriteUnsafe that take a cursor and close it after use.

This handle is unsafe because it does not enforce its own invariants. Instead, it assumes a careful user who has studied Okio\u2019s implementation details and their consequences. Buffer Internals Most code should use Buffer as a black box: a class that holds 0 or more bytes of data with efficient APIs to append data to the end and to consume data from the front. Usually this is also the most efficient way to use buffers because it allows Okio to employ several optimizations, including: Fast Allocation: Buffers use a shared pool of memory that is not zero-filled before use. Fast Resize: A buffer\u2019s capacity can change without copying its contents. Fast Move: Memory ownership can be reassigned from one buffer to another. Fast Copy: Multiple buffers can share the same underlying memory. Fast Encoding and Decoding: Common operations like UTF-8 encoding and decimal decoding do not require intermediate objects to be allocated. These optimizations all leverage the way Okio stores data internally. Okio Buffers are implemented using a doubly-linked list of segments. Each segment is a contiguous range within a 8 KiB ByteArray . Each segment has two indexes, start , the offset of the first byte of the array containing application data, and end , the offset of the first byte beyond start whose data is undefined. New buffers are empty and have no segments: val buffer = Buffer() We append 7 bytes of data to the end of our empty buffer. Internally, the buffer allocates a segment and writes its new data there. The lone segment has an 8 KiB byte array but only 7 bytes of data: buffer.writeUtf8(\"sealion\") // [ 's', 'e', 'a', 'l', 'i', 'o', 'n', '?', '?', '?', ...] // ^ ^ // start = 0 end = 7 When we read 4 bytes of data from the buffer, it finds its first segment and returns that data to us. As bytes are read the data is consumed. The segment tracks this by adjusting its internal indices. buffer.readUtf8(4) // \"seal\" // [ 's', 'e', 'a', 'l', 'i', 'o', 'n', '?', '?', '?', ...] // ^ ^ // start = 4 end = 7 As we write data into a buffer we fill up its internal segments. When a write doesn\u2019t fit into a buffer\u2019s last segment, additional segments are allocated and appended to the linked list of segments. Each segment has its own start and end indexes tracking where the user\u2019s data begins and ends. val xoxo = new Buffer() xoxo.writeUtf8(\"xo\".repeat(5_000)) // [ 'x', 'o', 'x', 'o', 'x', 'o', 'x', 'o', ..., 'x', 'o', 'x', 'o'] // ^ ^ // start = 0 end = 8192 // // [ 'x', 'o', 'x', 'o', ..., 'x', 'o', 'x', 'o', '?', '?', '?', ...] // ^ ^ // start = 0 end = 1808 The start index is always inclusive and the end index is always exclusive . The data preceding the start index is undefined, and the data at and following the end index is undefined. After the last byte of a segment has been read, that segment may be returned to an internal segment pool. In addition to reducing the need to do garbage collection, segment pooling also saves the JVM from needing to zero-fill byte arrays. Okio doesn\u2019t need to zero-fill its arrays because it always writes memory before it reads it. But if you look at a segment in a debugger you may see its effects. In this example, one of the \u201cxoxo\u201d segments above is reused in an unrelated buffer: val abc = new Buffer() abc.writeUtf8(\"abc\") // [ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'o', 'x', 'o', 'x', 'o', ...] // ^ ^ // start = 0 end = 3 There is an optimization in Buffer.clone() and other methods that allows two segments to share the same underlying byte array. Clones can\u2019t write to the shared byte array; instead they allocate a new (private) segment early. val nana = new Buffer() nana.writeUtf8(\"na\".repeat(2_500)) nana.readUtf8(2) // \"na\" // [ 'n', 'a', 'n', 'a', ..., 'n', 'a', 'n', 'a', '?', '?', '?', ...] // ^ ^ // start = 2 end = 5000 nana2 = nana.clone() nana2.writeUtf8(\"batman\") // [ 'n', 'a', 'n', 'a', ..., 'n', 'a', 'n', 'a', '?', '?', '?', ...] // ^ ^ // start = 2 end = 5000 // // [ 'b', 'a', 't', 'm', 'a', 'n', '?', '?', '?', ...] // ^ ^ // start = 0 end = 6 Segments are not shared when the shared region is small (ie. less than 1 KiB). This is intended to prevent fragmentation in sharing-heavy use cases. Unsafe Cursor API This class exposes privileged access to the internal byte arrays of a buffer. A cursor either references the data of a single segment, it is before the first segment ( offset == -1 ), or it is after the last segment ( offset == buffer.size ). Call UnsafeCursor.seek to move the cursor to the segment that contains a specified offset. After seeking, UnsafeCursor.data references the segment\u2019s internal byte array, UnsafeCursor.start is the segment\u2019s start and UnsafeCursor.end is its end. Call UnsafeCursor.next to advance the cursor to the next segment. This returns -1 if there are no further segments in the buffer. Use Buffer.readUnsafe to create a cursor to read buffer data and Buffer.readAndWriteUnsafe to create a cursor to read and write buffer data. In either case, always call UnsafeCursor.close when done with a cursor. This is convenient with Kotlin\u2019s use extension function. In this example we read all of the bytes in a buffer into a byte array: val bufferBytes = ByteArray(buffer.size.toInt()) buffer.readUnsafe().use { cursor -> while (cursor.next() != -1) { System.arraycopy(cursor.data, cursor.start, bufferBytes, cursor.offset.toInt(), cursor.end - cursor.start); } } Change the capacity of a buffer with resizeBuffer . This is only permitted for read+write cursors. The buffer\u2019s size always changes from the end: shrinking it removes bytes from the end; growing it adds capacity to the end. Warnings Most application developers should avoid this API. Those that must use this API should respect these warnings. Don\u2019t mutate a cursor. This class has public, non-final fields because that is convenient for low-level I/O frameworks. Never assign values to these fields; instead use the cursor API to adjust these. Never mutate data unless you have read+write access. You are on the honor system to never write the buffer in read-only mode. Read-only mode may be more efficient than read+write mode because it does not need to make private copies of shared segments. Only access data in [start..end) . Other data in the byte array is undefined! It may contain private or sensitive data from other parts of your process. Always fill the new capacity when you grow a buffer. New capacity is not zero-filled and may contain data from other parts of your process. Avoid leaking this information by always writing something to the newly-allocated capacity. Do not assume that new capacity will be filled with 0 ; it will not be. Do not access a buffer while is being accessed by a cursor. Even simple read-only operations like Buffer.clone are unsafe because they mark segments as shared. Do not hard-code the segment size in your application. It is possible that segment sizes will change with advances in hardware. Future versions of Okio may even have heterogeneous segment sizes. These warnings are intended to help you to use this API safely. It\u2019s here for developers that need absolutely the most throughput. Since that\u2019s you, here\u2019s one final performance tip. You can reuse instances of this class if you like.

When a task times out, it is left in an unspecified state and should be abandoned. For example, if reading from a source times out, that source should be closed and the read should be retried later. If writing to a sink times out, the same rules apply: close the sink and retry later. Timeouts and Deadlines \u00b6 This class offers two complementary controls to define a timeout policy. Timeouts specify the maximum time to wait for a single operation to complete. Timeouts are typically used to detect problems like network partitions. For example, if a remote peer doesn\u2019t return any data for ten seconds, we may assume that the peer is unavailable. Deadlines specify the maximum time to spend on a job, composed of one or more operations. Use deadlines to set an upper bound on the time invested on a job.
